                    Hello, I am Thabo Sekgotho, a tech enthusiast and budding entrepreneur currently pursuing cloud certification with ALX. 
                    I am a tenacious individual who is well-spoken, enthusiastic, and curious about the world around me. This has warranted 
                    many opportunities, such as acquiring an undergraduate degree in Information Systems and representing the country at the 
                    People to People International Leadership Summit hosted by Harvard University. I am proficient in more than five programming 
                    languages and trained in extracting meaningful information from data to inform business decisions. My leadership skills have 
                    served me well both on and off the field, supported by the multiple roles that I have been entrusted with in the past. Another 
                    worthwhile skill that I possess is patience and efficacy - I pride myself on seeing things through. What makes me stand out is 
                    my charisma and dedication to what I set my mind to. I work well with others and dedicate myself to the fulfillment of all 
                    objections and goals. Having me as part of your organization will warrant a trusted and hard-working individual who is results-oriented. 
                    This will result in a more productive and less strenuous execution of daily business processes. Should you ever need a charismatic, 
                    energetic, and dedicated individual to form part of your team, I employ you to reach out to me via my personal website, email, or 
                    LinkedIn. In an ever-changing technological environment, employers need curious and self-motivated individuals in their teams - those 
                    values are what I uphold each and every day.
