                    Good day

                    I am Thabo Sekgotho, a tech enthusiast and budding entrepreneur currently pursuing AWS cloud certification with ALX. 
                    I am a tenacious individual who is constantly driven by the curiosity of discovery. This has warranted many opportunities, such as 
                    acquiring an undergraduate degree in Information Systems and representing my country at the 2015 People to People Leadership Summit 
                    hosted by Harvard University. I am proficient in more than five programming languages and trained in extracting meaningful information 
                    from data to inform business decisions. My leadership skills have served me well both on and off the field. This is supported by the 
                    numerous roles that I have been entrusted with in the past. Another worthwhile skill that I possess is that of patience and efficacy 
                    - I truly pride myself with seeing things through. What makes me stand out is my charisma and dedication to what I set my mind to. I 
                    work well with others and dedicate myself to the fulfillment of all my objectives and goals. Having me as part of your organisation 
                    will warrant a trusted, hard-working, results-oriented individual. This will result in a more productive and less strenuous execution 
                    of your daily business tasks. Should you ever need a charismatic, energetic, and dedicated individual to form part of your team, I 
                    employ you to reach out to me via email, LinkedIn, or on this platform. In an ever-changing technological environment, employers need 
                    curious and self-motivated individuals in their arsenal - values are what I uphold each and every day.
